# CSE142-Spring2021-Assessment2-SpaceNeedle
Take-home Assessment 1: Space Needle

#Program Behavior
#Part A: ASCII Art
The first part of your assessment is to write a program that produces any text art (sometimes called "ASCII art") picture you like. Your program can produce any picture you like, with the following restrictions:
- The picture should be your own creation, not an ASCII image you found on the Internet or elsewhere.
- The picture should not include hateful, offensive, or otherwise inappropriate images.
- The picture should consist of between 3 and 200 lines of output, with no more than 100 characters per line.
- The picture must not be substantially similar to your solution for Part B, consist entirely of reused Part B code, or be substantially similar to a related CSE142 assignments from a previous quarter.
- The code must use at least one for loop or static methodbut should not contain infinite loops.
- The code must not use material beyond Ch. 3 of the textbook.

This part of the assessment will only contribute to the Behavior dimension grade. It will not factor in to grading on the other dimensions.

##Part B: Space Needle

As on assessment 1, you must exactly match the output. The second part of your assessment is to produce a specific text figure that is supposed to look like Seattle’s Space Needle. Your program should exactly reproduce the format of the output to the left, including characters and spacing. The Mark button in Ed will be helpful in confirming you’ve produced the correct output.

You should be able to change a single value at one point in the code to scale the figure. In addition to producing the default Space Needle shown below, your program will need to be able to be easily modified to produce similar images of different sizes. You will still only turn in one program, and your program will only produce one size of output on any given run. However, we should be able to make a single change to your code and recompile to produce a different size.
